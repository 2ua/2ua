## About Me ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently enjoying the world of coding at Codam, part of the 42Network, through the very intense Piscine program.

## My History
- **Programming for 3 years**: My first Programming language was Lua. With this language I developed small minigames in Roblox, and abused some exploits in games to enhance my security knowledge.
- **Roblox Pentesting**: I worked with many experiences to quell cheaters by using penetration testing to find security vulnerabilities and employing anti-cheat measurements.
- **My Greatest Accomplishment**: In an experience that currently has **8.5 Million plays**, I succesfully identified and patched a security vulnerability that allowed cheaters to delete other players' data.

## What I'm Learning
- **C Programming**: Building a strong foundation in the C language.
- **Unix and Shell**: Navigating the command line.
- **Version Control**: Using Git for project management.
- **Peer Learning**: Engaging with peers to solve complex problems and share knowledge.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me. I'm always open to feedback and collaboration!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
